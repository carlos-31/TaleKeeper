## üõ†Ô∏è Architecture & Tech Used

This app is built with a modern and robust architecture, prioritizing separation of concerns, scalability, and maintainability.

### Architecture
* **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel):** The core architecture separates UI logic (View) from business logic (ViewModel) and data sources (Model/Repository).
* **Repository Pattern:** A single source of truth for all app data, abstracting data sources (Firebase) from the ViewModels.

### Tech Used
* **Language:** **Java**
* **Core:** Android SDK
* **Jetpack Components:**
    * **ViewModel:** To manage UI-related data in a lifecycle-conscious way.
    * **LiveData:** To build observable data flows that automatically update the UI.
    * **Navigation Component:** To handle all in-app navigation.
    * **Data Binding & View Binding:** To bind UI components in layouts to data sources, reducing boilerplate code.
    * **AppCompatDelegate:** For theme (Light/Dark) and language management.
    * **SharedPreferences:** For persisting user settings like theme and language choice.
* **Backend:**
    * **Firebase Realtime Database:** NoSQL cloud database for storing book and user data.
    * **Firebase Authentication:** For handling user sign-up, login, and management.
* **UI & Image Loading:**
    * **Material Design 3:** For modern and responsive UI components.
    * **RecyclerView:** For efficiently displaying large lists of data.
    * **Glide:** For fast and efficient image loading and caching.

## üöÄ Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

* **Android Studio:** Make sure you have the latest version of Android Studio installed.
* **Firebase Account:** You'll need a free Firebase account to connect the backend.

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the Repository**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/carlos-31/TaleKeeper.git
    cd TaleKeeper
    ```

2.  **Configure Firebase**
    This project uses Firebase, but the `google-services.json` config file is not included for security reasons. You must create your own.

    1.  Go to the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/) and click **"Add project"**.
    2.  In your new project, click the **Android icon** to add an Android app.
    3.  Enter the package name of the application (you can find it in `app/build.gradle` under `applicationId`).
    4.  Download the generated **`google-services.json`** file.
    5.  Place the downloaded `google-services.json` file in the **`app/`** directory of your project.
    6.  In the Firebase Console, navigate to the **Authentication** section and enable the **"Email/Password"** sign-in provider.
    7.  Navigate to the **Realtime Database** section, create a database, and select **"Start in test mode"** for initial read/write access.

3.  **Set Up the Database Structure**
    The app requires a specific data structure in the Realtime Database to function.

    1.  In the repository, locate the file named **`realtime_database_example.json`**. This file contains the schema and sample data.
    2.  In your Firebase Realtime Database, click the three-dot menu and select **"Import JSON"**.
    3.  Upload the `realtime_database_example` file.

4.  **Build and Run**
    You're all set! Open the project in Android Studio, let Gradle sync, and run the app on an emulator or a physical device.
